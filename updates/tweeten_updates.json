With the latest release, we are removing suggestions for spell-check from the Windows app due to performance issues. After you install the update, the app should run smoothly from now on. Keep in mind that spell-check is still here, and we just removed the suggestions from the feature.</p> <p class='changelog'>On Mac, we are adding support for spell-check with Beta 1.7.2. Just like the Windows app, you won't get suggestions for incorrectly spelt words.</p> <p class='changelog'>As usual, if you have any feedback, please let us know via Twitter (@tweetenapp). Happy Tweeting! </p></div>",
