We are also releasing Tweeten 1.7.1 with a bunch of imrpovements and bug fixes for our Windows app.</p> <p class='changelog'>TweetDeck recently changed some of the text elements' color in the dark theme. We have changed the text elements back to their normal colors as the TweetDeck colors simply looked bad in the Dark (and Light) themes.</p> <p class='changelog'>We have also fixed a bug which sometimes expanded the navigation bar when the user clicked on the compose tweet button. Additonally, we fixed a bug which caused the app to crash when you tried to drag and drop an image.</p> <p class='changelog'>Lastly, we have fixed the issue which caused the text in Dropdown menus to be invisible in the Light theme. We also fixed the Direct Messaging UI in Light Theme with 1.7.1.</p> <p class='changelog'>As usual, if you have any feedback, please let us know via Twitter (@tweetenapp). Happy Tweeting! </p></div>",
